This is the notes for consuming promises

lets rewrite our asynchronous code using promises
(in code start on line 11 to see the difference)

from (line 12 )
So we have our then statement that accepts the result 
we can now chain then to what we got from the user function (line 13)
if this function returns a value we'll wrap that value inside a promise this means if
line 13 returns a value we're going to have another promise then that promise is returned 

this is the beauty of using promises
promises expose the then method we can chain them to implex the complex
asynchronous operation

Now as best practices when we are working with promises we need to catch any errors
