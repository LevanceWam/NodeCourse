this is the notes for CreatingSettledPromises

Upto this point we have seen a decent bit of promise in the section 
in this lecture we are going to explore the API of promise objects in JS in more details

So lets create a file called promise-api.js 
This file will be for practice 

Sometimes we want to make a promise that is already resolve this is particulary useful when writing unit test 
when we want to simulate a scenario where an asynchronous operation like calling a web service
completes successfully in our unit test we want to create a promise
that is already resolve

(go to code line 2)
if that is what we need we can call the promise call in JS it has a static method called resolve
this will return a promise that is already resolved 

We can optionally pass a value like 1 or a user object and we get the promise this promise is 
already resolve so now we can call the then method on the object (line 3)

We can also do this with a promise that is already rejected
so instead of calling resolve set it to reject
(go to line 7)

then we need to call catch
remember it is better to call a error when ever we want to reject a promise 
because its better to use a native error object because it will include a callstack
