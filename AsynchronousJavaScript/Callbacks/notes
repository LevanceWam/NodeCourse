This is the notes for callbacks

We are going to learn how to use a callback to get a user object

first inside of the getUser function we need to add another parameter 
and we are going to call it callback (go to line 9 in code )
A callbacknis a function that we are going to call when the result of a 
asynchronous operation is ready.

In this case and point the result is ready, so we are going to call this function back 
with the user object that we created (lines 13 and 14 in code)
so we simply call this callback (line 12 in code ) and give it the user object

back to line 42 in the code we do not need the variable anymore this is because we are not getting a return value
Now the getUser function needs a second argument we are going to pass a function that will be called with this argument
the function takes a user and now we have access to the user object we have read from the database 
we can display it on the console like this (line 43 in code)

so we can now pass the function in the second agrument the function takes a user because we are taking a user object

Lets do a exercise:
In this program lets imagine once we read a user object from the database we are going to look
at the githubusername property and we are going to call the github api
to get the list of repositories from that user 

Our job is to convert the function on line 48 to a asynchronous function and call in in the asynchronous function
getUser once we have the user object we need to get the repositories
when we convert the function make sure it takes 2 seconds to complete and that we are using a callback to get the results 
and display all of the results in the console

So at the bottom of the file this is the old code that was at the top of the file and the beginning of the exercise
