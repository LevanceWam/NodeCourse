This is the notes for Replacing Callbacks with functions

To solve our Callback hell problem we need to modify our asynchronous functions to return a promise 

we are going to modify getUser function to return a promise 
(go to line 12 in code)
we are going to move the setTimeout inside of the promise
next we are going to remove our callback parameter 
then (on line 16) change callback to resolve

Quick exercise do this for the other 2 functions 
now that we completed the exercise 

none of the functions use a Callback
now in the next lecture we are going to consume these promises
