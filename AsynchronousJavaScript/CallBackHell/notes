This is the notes for callback hell

What we need to note in our code is that on (line 2 in the code)
is a nest of stuctures so we have getUser and were we are nesting 
we then go to gitRepo

In a real world application maybe we want to do something after we get the list of repos for the user 
perhaps we want to go to the first repository and get all of the commits in that 
repository

With callbacks our code will end up looking like (go to code line 4)

If we were to write the sychronous version of this code it is a lot easier to read 
than the nest of callbacks

This nest of callbacks is called callback hell or christmas tree problem
in the next lecture we are going to look at how to solve the problem
