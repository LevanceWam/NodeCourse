This is the notes for WritingCleanTest

In this lecture we are going to learn mosh's technique for refractoring
code this is his own technique that he came up with 

We are going to refractor this code we because we noticed there are some parts that are repeating themselves

so at the top if the POST test suite we want to 
define the happy path and then in each test we chnage one parameter that clearly aligns with the name of the test

so first lets define the happy path
so lets go back to were we defined it and bring it to the top
we are going to want to mark it with a todo so we know to come back and put our happy path there 

so at the top of the suite lets define a function called exec and paste the code in this function
we want to return this immediately and don't forget if since we have await we have to prefix the function with async

now back to the TODO we are going to await the function and since we didn't need the res object here we can leave it as is 

now lets work on the first test 
what we notice in the first test is that we don't have a token 
so before we call the exec function we need to get rid of the token
so lets define token at the top of the block this will make token undefined

now back to the first test, if we want to conduct this test without the user being logged in  we just need to
set the token to a empty string 
this works because this test doesn't need a token 

now for the other test we are generating a token for these test this is repetitive so we should set the token as 
a valid jwt that way we don't have to keep defining it and since the test that doesn't need the token  this works
perfect because it'll just set it to a empty string 

so we need to move the generateAuthToken into a before each

we are going to download the video for the rest of the notes it is a lot of information
