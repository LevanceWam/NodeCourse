This is the notes for TestingTheInvalidInputs

now lets assume that the user is logged in but they are sending a invalid genre

so we are going to load the user object so we can generate a token so we look like we logged in 
then using the set method we are going to set the header 
we pass the name of the header we want to use and then the value  which is our token 

then we are going to send the minimum amount of characters to get a validation error 
and test it 

after testing the minimum amount we are going to test the maximum amount to make sure that works also
but instead of having to type a long ugly string we are going to do it a easier way 

if we get a 500 error this is because we didn't set up the requirements on joi to match the one in mongoose
