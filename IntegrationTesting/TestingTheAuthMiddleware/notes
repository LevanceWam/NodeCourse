This is the notes for TestingTheAuthMiddleware

so currently we have a single test to test the authorization if the  client doesn't give us a 
token we expect the status to be 401

but if we look at the authorization implementation in middleware/auth.js
we can see that we have multiple execution paths
the reason why we haven't tested this everywhere is because we would have to test this for every route 
we use this for and we don't want to do that the auth test we did so far makes sense on where we have it 

So what we need to do is create the auth middleware function own test
so we need to make a file called auth.test.js in the test folder

now here we are mixing the auth test and routes test in the future we are going to seperate them by folder
like we have done with everything else

next we are going to want to set up our describe block
then complete our first test case 
this is just like the one we did in the other lecture 
now in the first case we are testing for if no token is being provided
if we pass anything even null as a token jwt will still convert it 
so it has to be empty for this test to return the status error that we want 

for the next test case we want to send a invalid token
for this we just need pass token as a random string and this test will pass

the next test will be our happy path
