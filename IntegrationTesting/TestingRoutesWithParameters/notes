This is the notes for TestingRoutesWithParameters

We were tasked with doing a exercise the exercise 
was to create 2 integration test for the get route handler 
that gets 1 specific genre

so to start we need to make a new test suite fof the handler 
once that is done we are going to create a new genre and remember since we are removing the 
documents in the genre database when we reach this test we are basically at a empty database

Then after that we are going to want to set up the response object and 
with this one we put the route for getting one genre document but instead of adding the /:id to the 
route we concatenate genre._id so it will look like this 
/api/genre/ + genre._id

Now to check and see in the response object body if the document is there we where going 
to use the toMatchObject() method and pass genre 

but the problem with this is when we run the test we are expecting _id to be an objectId but 
when we look at why we failed we recieve a string 
this is one of the issues  we have when we are writing mongoose models because 
when we save genre to the database mongoose is assigning the id property and sends it to objectId
and when we read it from the database it will be a string

so this is our way around it 
we will use the method toHaveProperty() and see if the object has a property and a value
so in this case the property should be name and the value should be genre.name (this is so it is not generic or specific)
now all of our test pass

in the next lecture we are going to write a second integration test for this endpoint 
for if the genre is not there
