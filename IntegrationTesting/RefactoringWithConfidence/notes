This is the notes for RefactoringWithConfidence

We are going to move the new logic we added on the route handler that 
gets one genre 
the logic that checks if the objectId is valid so we can use it in multiple places 

so in middleware folder we are going to add a new file
then create the middleware function and add the logic there 

now back in routes/genre we are going to load the middleware function
then place in in the route handler function

now that we have all the execution paths covered all of our test will pass 

with automated test we can refactor our code in confidence
