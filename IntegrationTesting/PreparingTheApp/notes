This is the notes for PreparingTheApp

Before we start the integration test we need to tweak the app a little bit
first in package.json we need to add the flag --verbose to our test property
This will help us troubleshoot problems when something goes wrong
with this flag jest will give us extra information in the console

in startup/logging.js we need to comment out the require for winston-mongodb 
while we are trying to do integration test jest and this module doesn't work together very well
and jest freezes the terminal if we try to use them together 

also comment out line 24
