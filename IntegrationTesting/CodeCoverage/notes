This is the notes for CodeCoverage

In this lecture we are going to learn how to see how much of our 
code is covered by test with jest

in package.json we need to modify our scripts property by adding the flag  coverage and then
running npm test again

now we have a report of all the code that is covered
for better visual representation we have a html layout for us to see
this is a prettier version that was in the terminal
this is located in the coverage folder
