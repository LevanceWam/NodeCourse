This is the notes for TestingTheHappyPath

so for our first execution path we had to write 2 test because there are 
various possibilities that the input can be invalid
This is what we meant by having to write the same amount or more test passed off off our 
execution paths 

now we are going to work on the happy path
we want to test if the genre is saved in the data base

so in the send method we are going to send genre object then we are going to
use the genre model to query the database and find the document 

now we expect the genre not to be null

now we are going to do the last test 
we want to make sure that the genre is in the body of the response

so all we are going to do is to expect that the propert has a id and a name 
to make sure it is the body
