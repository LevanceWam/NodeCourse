This is the notes for SettingUpTheTestDB

Remember that we run integration test off of real databases
but we do not want this database to be apart of the development database or the production one 
because in our integration test we are going to be adding and removing documents from the test database
so we don't want to mess up any of the data in the other databases

So we are going to create our own testing database
So in the config folder we go to default.json and add a new key 
called db  and we will set it to our default MongoDB connection string 
then overwrite it in test config file or test envirnoment

so in startup/db.js take the connection string and place it in the db key value and remove it from db.js 
then in config/test.json add the db property and at the end of it put _test so signal that this is a test db

now back in db we need to load the config module and then we are going to dynamically read the connection string on the envirnoment in which the application is running
so in short this will read whether we are in the test, development, or production envirnoment
