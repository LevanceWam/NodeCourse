This is the notes for TestingTheAuthorization

in this lecture we are going to test the route handler for creating 
new genres
In this handler we are going to need 2 test 
for the first execution pass if the genre is invalid we are going to return a status of 400

then the other path we need 2 test 
we need to make sure that the genre is saved to the database 
so we are going to have to query the database ans ensure that the genre is sent is in there 
with the other test we want to make sure that genre is in the body of the request
then we for the auth we need to make sure that the user is logged in if not return a 401 error


in in the test file genre.test.js
we are going to make a new test suite and we are going to start by 
making a test for the authorization
this time when we are using the request function the method we put at the end is going to be post 
since we are using the post route handler 

and at the end of it we are going to send a genre to test if we are logged in
