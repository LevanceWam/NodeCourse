This is notes for RestructingTheProject

If we take a look at our video app structure we can see that we 
have our customer model then our routes handlers and finally our validate function

since this is a simple application this is not that big of a project and we do not have much to work on from our model

But in the real world the current models we are working in are going to be more complex 
so the code in the module will grow

This is something we need to work on, we need to keep the application maintainable
to do this we need to make sure that each module is responible for one thing 

this is known as single responibility
Basically anything that is in the routes folder should just be dealing with just that routes 
and anything that has to do with the models should work on the models 

so for this lecture we need to extract our customer object and the validate function that uses Joi and put them in a new folder called models 
inside of the models folder we created the customer.js file and 
moved the customer model and the validate function here 

now that we removed these two from the routes we need to export the customer class and the validate function so we can connect it to the routes

now when we go back into the routes we need to load the two properties that we are exporting from models/customer.js
those being the Customer class and validate 

The best way to load them and have your code look clean is to use object destructing 
now instead of loading 1 object and having to go in the code and type something like Customer.customer or Customer.validate 
we can destructure the object into 2 constants or variables 

now if we look at our code it is a lot shorter than when we first started

Now as another exercise we need to restructure the genre routes by 
getting rid of the Genre class and the validate function and move it into the models folder
