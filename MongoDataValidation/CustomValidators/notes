This is the notes for CustomValidators

At some point the built in validators we have in mongoose
will not be able to do the things that we need

For example
lets say that we wanted to enforce the rule with our tags (with the way it is now a string array)
that every course should have at least one tag or atleast one string in the array
the required property can not help us here because if we pass it blank this is acceptable in mongoose point of view 

This is where we would need a custom validator
so lets start off by working inside of the tags property

Once we pass the object and set the type to array
we are going to add a property called validate this is where our custom validator goes in
we pass an object and in this object we set the property validator which we set to a function
the function takes a value (which is v) and inside of the function we add the custom validation logic 

We can aslo set a custom message when it fails 
the validate object has another property called message

now if we where to leave it empty or skip the tag property at all it will validate and show us an error message 
(The reason why the validation goes off if we skip the tag is because mongoose will make it a empty array and our logic calls for length greater than 0)

now if we pass it as null it will give us a validation message but not the kind that we want so we have to tweak the logic inside of the validator to fix that 
Now  we have it to where if v has a value and is greater than 0 we won't see the validation message
