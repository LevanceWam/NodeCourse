This is the notes for Built-inValidators

With our required property we can set to a boolean or make it a function that returns a boolean
this is useful for if we want to make a property required or not

so as an example lets try to make price required if the course is published 

on the price property we pass an object 
set the type and then pass the require property
inside of it we pass a function 
this is were we return the boolean
we use this here to reference the course object

Now if isPublished is true then price will be required

*important* 
We can not replace the function we have here with a arrow function this is because 
they do not have their own this 
they use the this value of the in closing execution
that means the validation will not work

Now depending on the properties we have. we have additional built in validators
for example Strings have:
min length // how many characters to have atleasr
max length // maximum amount
match // we can pass regular expression here 
enum // to set an array of valid strings

Number: 
min 
max

Date:
min 
max
