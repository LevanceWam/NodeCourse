This is the notes for async validators

In this lecture we are going to be looking at async validators
This will be useful when are trying to get rid of something from the database or
remote http service since we won't have the answer right away we'll make it
asynchronous

So we will learn how to convert a synchronous validator to a asynchronous one 

so inside of the validate property object we are going to pass
a new property called isAsync and set it to true 
then inside of the function we need to add a callback
now when the result is ready we will call the callback and get the results

now in the real world our result will be something that we get calculated from the file system,
database, or a removed service.

In short Async validators are easy all we need to do is:
set the Async property
pass a callback function
