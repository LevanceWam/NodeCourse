This is the notes for SchemaTypeOptions

When we are defining a schema we know that we can set the 
type of property directly on the property or pass an object

We are going to take a look at some more properties that we have with the 
schema type object

For Strings we have 3 more properties we can use:
lowercase // this converts everything in the catergory property to lowercase
uppercase // converts everything in the catergory property to uppercase
trim // if there is any padding around the string this property removes them
These 3 properties are availiable when using the string type

We still have a couple more properties in the schema type object and these properties can be used when defining any property 
no matter the type

Lets take a lot at our price property
lets say that we always want to round the value of the price 
we can define a custom getter and setter 

The setter is called when we set the value of a property like in the createCourse
The getter is called when we read the value of a property

So if we get a course and the value was saved before we made the getter and the setter 
the getter will round it for us
