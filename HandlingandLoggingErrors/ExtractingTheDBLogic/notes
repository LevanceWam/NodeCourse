This is the notes for ExtractingTheDBLogic

so in this lecture we are continuing from a previous lecture 
exercise to move all of the code that has to deal with databases and move it to its own module 
we successfully accomplished this with some changes

so in startup folder create a file name db.js

The first change we made was to the promise object when we connect to mongo
instead of logging we connected to MongoDB and catching it we are going to use 
winston.info to take care of this for us

We are using winston to log this as a information message and if the process fails
we can log the expection and exit the process upon failure 

finally in index.js we need to load this new module we create 
so all we need to do is repeat the same process as before like with the routes
and require it in index.js 

dont forget since we are exporting a function we have to call it like this 

require('./startup/db.js')();
make sure to add the () at the end to call the function
in the next lecture we are going to do the same for logging the errors
