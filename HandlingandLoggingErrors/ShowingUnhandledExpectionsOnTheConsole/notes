This is the notes for ShowingUnhandledExpectionsOnTheConsole

So we have a tiny little issue with the current application
If we where to give this to another developer and they are working on a different machine if something 
were to break they would have no idea what is going on because the app terminates with out telling us what is going on

even though we are using winston to log our errors if we handed this off to a team they would have no idea what is going on 

so in our startup/logging.js we are going to add a new transport log the errors on the console 
after we add the new transport we will now will get a errors in the console
