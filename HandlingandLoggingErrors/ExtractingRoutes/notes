This is the notes for ExtractingRoutes
in the index.js

The main issue we have here is the seperation of concerns there are too many things going on 
this is why we have so many require statements and other code

We shouldn't have so many things going on like this we should only be orcestrate these concerns 
so the details of setting up these things should be in their own modules
so lets start on extracting some of this code to there own file 

Lets extract our routes
So lets create a folder called startup and make a file called routes.js 
here we are going to export all the code that is for setting up our routes and other middleware 

Looking at our dependencies we have a app object to express all of these route handlers
so back in index.js
we want to have a single instance of the app object for the entire application because we dont want to create a new app object in our new module 
so what we want to do is referece the app object we have here in the index.js
so over in startup/routes.js we are going to pass app as a argument and 
when we require startup/routes.js we are going to pass our app object

after that is done we need to move all of the routers from index.js to startup/routes.js
because nowhere in the index are we referencing them 

NOTE dont forget to fix our routes in startup/routes.js

as a exercise lets try to move all the database intialization code to a different module
we will attempt it in the next folder
