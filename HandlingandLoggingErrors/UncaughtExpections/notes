this is the notes for UncaughtExpections

The error middleware we have here only catches errors that are part of the request processing pipeline this is particular to express
if any error is thrown outside the context of express the error middleware will not work

so if any error during this current implementation outside of express context nothing happens
so lets learn how to properly handle unhandled expections in a node processs not tied to express

lets take a look at the process object
the process object is a event emitter that can emit or publish events and it gives us a method on used to subcribe to an events

in node we have a standard event called UncaughtExpection
this event is raised when we have an expection in the node process
but nowhere have we handled that expection using a catch block
We have to make sure that UncaughtExpection is spelled correctly or it will not work

if there is a UncaughtExpection we want to handle it using the function we defined
the function takes the expection object and we can log it and then use winston to log it
