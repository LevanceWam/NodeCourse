this is notes for ErrorHandlingRecap

Quick rundown abut everything we learned about errorhandling 

In express we have a middleware error function that takes 4 parameters
error, req, res and next 

this function catches any errors in the request processing pipeline 
we use a package called winston to catch these errors but winston by default 
only catches errors in the pipeline will ignore everything else outside the context of express
