This is the notes for ExpressAsyncErrors

While our async function in middleware/async solved the problem of repetitive trycatch blocks 
the issue we have is we have to rememeber to call it everytime 
it also makes our code a little noisy

So lets learn a different approach we are going to use a npm module and this module will monkey patch
our route handler at runtime so when we send a request to an endpoint the module will wrap
our route handler code inside something our route handler template 

in terminal we want to install:
npm i express-async-errors

we need to load this module when the application starts so in idex.js 
load it at the top
we do not need to store it inside of a variable 

now back in routes/genres.js
we can get rid of asyncMiddle function and revert it back to the way we had our route handler originally 
then we can remove the require statement that loaded the async module from middleware folder

now lets test everything in terminal to make sure that everything is working correctly 

So we tested it ansd this verifies that the new module that we installed 
properly moved control from our route handler or error handler function
this module makes it easy for handling async errors
