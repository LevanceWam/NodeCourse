This is the notes for ExtractingTheLoggingLogic

Continuing from the prevoius lecture our exercise was to move the 
code that has to deal with logging errors into its own module
we did it successfully

so remember we need to make a new file called logging 
and we need to use module.exports to export our function 

We also need to load the correct modules for logging.js 

After that we need to require the logging.js module in index like we did the others

next exercise is to move the config code into its own module
