this is the notes for ExtractTheValidateLogic

Continued exercise from the previous lecture 
we moved all of the code that has to relate to validating in 
startup/validate.js

important note we placed the Joi.objectId inside of our function that we are exporting
will look into why this was done later 

also in our app.listen we changed from a console log to a winston.info
