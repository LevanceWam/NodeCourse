this is the notes for LoggingToMongoDB

lets try to log messages to MongoDB
We need a new npm package 
npm i winston-mongodb
(if we have any issues use version 3.0.0)

back in index.js
lets load the winston-mongodb package 
we just need to require it no need to store it 
under our first winston transport

we need to call winston.add(winston.transports.MongoDB)
we pass a options object and set the property to db and then set the connection string 
there are other properties we can use we have to look at the documentation

Now in the real world we are going to want to seperate our log from our operational database 
this is a decision that varies from one enviroment to another 

now if we get another error we will go automatically to the database 
it will create a new colletion called log and in this is the message we logged 

in index.js we can also set the level property inside of the transport and when we do this 
lets say for error we will only get the error messages and if we use info we will gwt the info, error, and warning messages also
