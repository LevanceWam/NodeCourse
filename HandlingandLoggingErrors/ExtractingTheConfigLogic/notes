This is the notes for ExtractingTheConfigLogic

So from the previous lecture we have been tasked to move 
all of the config code over to its new module
the same way as we did the others
The code can be found in startup/config.js

now instead of consoling if the jwtPrivateKey is not defined we should throw an exception and 
let our logging process catch the exception
Also as a best practice throw a error object instead of strings 
this is because when we throw a error object the stack trace will be available for us to see later 

next do the same exercise with the validation (joi)
