This is the intro to the section 

So far the wamVid app has been built with the assumption that everything will be perfect 
but we know in the real world strange things happen 

For example our MongoDB can lose connection ofr what ever reason
as best practices we should count on these unexpected situations and handle them properly 
which means we need to send the proper errot message to the client 
and log the expection on the server

This way we can look at the log later and see some of the issues that are happening frequently and how we can improve them
