This is the notes for JSONWebTokens

We are going to modify our response for when we authenticate the user 
instead of sending true we are going to send a JSON Web Token

JSONWebToken:
is basically a long string that identifies a user 
Think of it as a drivers license or passport

So when the user logs on to the server we generate the web Token
which is like a license or passport and give it to the client and then tell them hey
next time you want to comeback here and call our API endpoint we need yoo 
to show us your passport this is our id

So on the client we need to store the JSONWebToken which is a string  so we can send it back so we can send
it back to the server for future api calls the client can be a web or mobile application
if it is a web app that is being built with angular or react we can use local storage 
this is a special storage that is availiable in every browser
if we are using mobile app there is something similar depending on what platform is bei
