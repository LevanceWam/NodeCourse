This is the notes for UsingLodash

In the user post method we need to modify the response to the client 
we have 2 options:

1. is to return a custom object 
 res.send({
        name: user.name,
        email: user.email
    });

This way we can exclude the password and the version properties

Approach 1 works really well but we are going to use a cool library that gives us a lot of utility functions
for working with objects

Say hello to lodash
https://lodash.com/

Its like a update version of underscore
first we need to install lodash 
npm i lodash

by convention we loaded lodash in the constant _ we can name it whatever we want but it is shorter and clean

so lets take a look at the utility method pick

with this method we pass the an object (User object for this example)
Then we pass an array of properties that we want to pick
this will return a new object with the properties we chose 
Now instead of typing out the first approach we can use the pick method 

Since we are using lodash we dont have to write out all of the user properties in the user object we are creating
We can use the pick method and passs req.body as the object and chose the properties like we did before 

Lets test it in the terminal and postman 

Now that we finished testing and everything is working 
We notice that we have been putting really simple passwords 
if we wanted to enforce password complexity we can use the npm package that is built on top of joi called joi-password-complexity
https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi-password-complexity

we are not going to use it in this project
