This is the notes for StoringSecretsInEnviromentVariables

remember earlier when we were using the node package called config 
we use config to store the configuration settings of our application in json files 
or enviroment variables 

in routes/auth.js we are going to move our secret string from our code and into the config
this is because we do not want our secrets visible to anyone who has the source code 

so first we install config 
npm i config

then we are going to want to create a folder called config and a configuration file called default.json
we add a simple json object we can have several setting in here if we want 
the one we are going to use is jwtkeyprivate 
in this file we are going to set this to an empty string the actual value will not be here
so we're just defining a template for all of the settings in the application

Now we create another file custom-enviroment-variables.json 
in this file we are going to specify the mapping between the application settings and the envirnoment variables 
this will be the stucture of the application setting object now we want to map this setting to enviroment variable 
called jwtprivatekey now inside of this we wan to make sure to prefix the private key 
with the name of application this way we don't end up giving this applications setting to another application

back to auth 
we load the config module and then
where we where passing the secret string we replace that with
config.get() and the name of the application setting 

the actual secret will be in the envirnoment settings 

another change we need to go make is in index.js when the app starts we want to make sure that the 
environment variable is set otherwise we need to terminate the application because then our authentication location endpoint  will not function
properly

now if we run this in terminal after adding the if statement for the config
we will get an error this is because we didnt set the variable key

so lets set the envirnoment variable for this so we can have the application running 
in terminal we set the envirnoment by typing (for mac):

export wamVid_jwtPrivateKey=someText
then run the application


NOTE: Please triple check that custom-environment-variable is spelled correctly I spent a good 10 mins trying to debug the problem
