For this section we are going to be focusing on 
the Authentication and Authorization of the vidly app

Authentication:
is the process of identifying if the user is who thet claim they are 
this is why we login in we save our username and password to the server 
and the server authenticates us 

Authorization:
is determinating if we have the right permissions to perform the given operation

as added sercuity we want to make sure admin users can delete data


we are going to have to add 2 new endpoints 2 the app:
// Register: POST /api/users
// Login: POST /api/logins

exercise lets implement the the register api to register new users
for each user they need:
name
email // set unique property to true this will prevent 2 of the same emails 
password
