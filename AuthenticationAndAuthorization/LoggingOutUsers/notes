This is the notes for LoggingOutUsers

In our routes/auth.js module we defined a route for authenticating users 
but what about logging out users would we need a seperate route for this?

The answer is no
this is because we are not storing the token on the server 
so we don't need a seperate route handler to delete the token 
so technically we need to implement the logging out feature on the client not on the server 

When the user wants to log out we simply delete the token from the client 

NOTE do not store token in database. Unless you are a "professional"
