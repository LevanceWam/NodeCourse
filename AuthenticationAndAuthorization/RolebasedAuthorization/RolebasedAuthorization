This is the notes for RolebasedAuthorization

Time to take the application to the next level again 
lets imagine certian operations such as deleting data can only be performed by admin
we are going to take a dive into RolebasedAuthorization

First we head to model/user.js 
we are going to add another property to see if a given user is a admin

next we are going to the users document in compass to make a admin

Now the next time they log in we want to add the new property to the jwt payload
so nect time we send the jwt to the server we can extract the 
property directly from the token we dont have to get the id or check

back in the user model when we generate the authentication token we want to add
the new property in the payload 

next we need to build a middleware function to see if the current user is a admin or not 
we need to create a new file in the middleware folder called admin.js

inside of the middleware function we are assuming this middleware function is executed after our authorization middleware function (sets: req.user)
we can access that in this function so if the user is not a admin return status 403 Forbidden

A lot of developers get 401 and 403 status wrong 
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden

We use Unauthorized when a user tries to access a protected resource but they dont supply a valid json web token
so we give them a chance to retry and send a valid jwt 

If they send a valid jwt and they are still not allowed to access the target resource that is when we use 403 for Forbidden

if the user is an admin then we just go to the next middleware function which is the route handler

In routes/genre.js we want to go to the delete route handler and as a second agrument we want to pass an array that contains 
auth and admin

the middleware functions will be executed in sequence 
First auth if the client send a valid jwt 
then we will get the second middleware function if the user is a admin 
then the 3rd midldleware function will execute

after we load the middleware function at the top we will go to test it in the next lecture
