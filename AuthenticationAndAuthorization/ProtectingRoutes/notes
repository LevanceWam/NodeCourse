this is the notes for ProtectingRoutes

Now that we have a middleware function and we can go to index.js and 
we can add it to the list of middleware functiions and it will executed
before every route handler but we don't want to do this because not all of the api endpoints should be protected 

some of the api endpoints should be public like registering a user or logging in
What we want to do is apply this middleware function selectively to certain endpoints 

lets go to routes/genres.js
in the post route handler
the first argument is the route 
the second is optionally middleware 
the third will be the actual route handler 

first we need to load the middleware 
finally we pass our middleware function as the second argument to be executed 
before the other middleware function which is the route handler in this case

as a exercise add the middle to functions that modify data
