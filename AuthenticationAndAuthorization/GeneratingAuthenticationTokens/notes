This is the notes for Generating Authentication Tokens 

in the terminal lets download jsonwebtoken
npm i jsonwebtoken

in auth.js before we send the response we need to create a jsonwebtoken
after we load the module we are going before the response
and call the .sign() method 

Here we are going to pass a payload this can be string or a object
the properties that we put in this object is entirely up to us 

as the second argument we are going to pass the secret or private key
remember this is used to create the private signature 

FOR NOW we are going to hard code the private key later we will learn how to put it in a enviroment variable 

when we call the sign method we get a token as the result 
we'll store it in a constant called token then we are going to
place it in our response

now we can go test it in postman and take the jsonwebtoken and go to jwt.io to decode it and see if it matches
