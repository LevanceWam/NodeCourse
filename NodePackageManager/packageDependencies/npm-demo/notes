These are notes for the section package dependencies 

We start off with an exercise to download 'mongoose' to our project
we do that by running this command: 
npm i mongoose

then we were tasked to install it and inspect it.

the first thing that we notice is in the package.json in the dependencies we have 2 of them now

we see that mongoose is running at version: ^5.9.24

if we go in the terminal and run this command:ls node_modules
after we run the command we acquire folders that we didn't download

these folders are other node packages that mongoose is dependent on

In previous versions of npm these packages would have been put in a node_module folder inside of folder named after 
the dependency that we installed. This created a mess because if we downloaded another dependency
and it had the same package as one we already had we would have multiple of the same dependency
the previous way also created a deeply nested stucture and on windows espically there is a limitation on the number of characters we can have in a path

npm has changed this behavior in recent versions now all dependencies and their dependencies are stored in the node_module folder 
the expection here is that if a dependency needed a certain version of 
a package it would save that version locally with that package

so for example:
If underscore needed async version 1 and mongoose needed version 2 
since we installed underscore first, mongoose will download async version 2 locally inside of installed
node_module folder.
