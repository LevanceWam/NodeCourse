this is the notes for listing the installed packages

Remember there is a chance when we are restoring our dependencies from the package.json 
that the version of a dependency that is inside of the node_modules folder is higher than the 
one we have in the package.json

there is 2 way we can check

One way is to look at the package.json file and look at version 
then we would go into the node_modules folder and click on the dependency scroll to the bottom and see the version that is listed

The other way is using the terminal

so if we want to see all of the dependencies and their versions we would type 
npm list
this will return a tree diagram of all the dependencies we have and their version

Now if we are interested in the dependencies we installed we would type
npm list --depth=0

this will return the dependecies we installed for our application
