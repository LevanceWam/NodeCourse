this is notes for working with global packages

all of the packages we installed are all ones that we can use in projects 

but we also have some that can be used from the command line globally 
some examlples we have are 
npm and angular cli 

these command line tools are not specific to one project they can be used anywhere

Tip: 
we can check out which of our global commands are outdated by typing this in terminal

npm -g outdated
