notes for viewing registry info for a package

to learn more about our packages we go to npmjs.org

we can search upa dependency and see what dependencies it needs
but there is a faster way to do this 

in terminal if we type:
npm view nameOfPackage 

this will return the package.json file for the package

we can also target a specific property in the package.json
like this:

npm view nameOfPackage dependencies
npm view nameOfPackage version

and so on
