this is notes on how to uninstall a package 

sometimes in the real world we want to uninstall a package 
this maybe because we may no longer require it if this is the case
in terminal we would run:

npm uninstall nameOfPackage or npm un nameOfPackage

so if we look at the package.json the package will not be there and 
it will not be in the node_modules folder either
