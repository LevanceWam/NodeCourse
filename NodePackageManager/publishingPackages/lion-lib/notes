These are notes for publishing a package

Let's try and publish a package to npm registry

first we need to intialize the folder with npm so we woill type
'npm init --yes'
this will give us a default/basic package.json

create a index.js because this is the entry point to our package
in the index.js we can export one or more functions
lets start by exporting a really simple function

go back in the terminal 
At this point if we do not have an account on npmjs we need to go create one
we can do that by running this command:
'npm adduser'

if we already have an account do this:
'npm login'

either way we'll get 3 questions
username
password
email

next to publish this package this is what we type in terminal
'npm publish'

when we try to push this we get an error because we do not have the correct permissions to modify this package
to solve this issue 
we have to go to the package.json and put in a unqiue name for the package
so simply add something or change the name 

then back in terminal run:
npm publish

now that it is up on npmjs.com we can use it in other node applications

we are gona make a new directory and download the package and use it 

in the new directory (mine is name test) run these commands:
npm init --yes 
npm install wamlion-lib

if we go into the node_modules and look at the package.json we'll see that there
is more metadata than we provided npm adds its own dependencies after we publish it 

now lets create a file name index.js in the test folder and require the module of our package
