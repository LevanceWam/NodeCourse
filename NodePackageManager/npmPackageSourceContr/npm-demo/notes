This is the notes for npm package source and control

Up to this point our node_module folder has quite a lot of folders inside of it
in the real world we are going to have more folders than this and the size of the node_module folder is going to be 
in the hundred megabytes 

when pushing our code to a repositry we want to avoid sending this up because everytime someone looks at our code or pulls it
they are going to get those files 

or if we want to send it by email bluetooth airdrop etc thats a lot of data to be downloaded and transfered

This is where our dependencies come to help us out.
So if we look inside of our package.json we will see that our dependencies are stored here
with npm along with the dependencies we can restore the versions of the dependencies on any machine

so we can delete the node_module folder and then go inside of terminal and run:
'npm i'

by doing this npm will look at the package.json and download the versions needed from there 

this is why we should exclude the node_module folder from our source code 
the way we can exclude this from our source code or repositry is by 
using a .gitignore if we are using git ignore.
