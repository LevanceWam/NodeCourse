notes for Devdependecies

so far all of the dependecies we installed are application dependecies like 
mongoose and underscore our applications need these in order to function properly but sometimes
we use dependecies that are only used during development 

For example:
We have tools for running a unit test, tools for doing static analysis on our code 
we have tools for bundling our JS code and so on

those dependecies are development dependecies and they should nor go in a production enviroment where we deploy our
application 

so lets learn how to install this dependecy called jshint which is a static analysis tool for JS code 
it basically analyzes our JS code and looks for potential problems or syntactical error

let's go into terminal and type 
npm install jshint --save-dev

inorder to specify that this is a development dependecy we add the flags
--save-dev

lets take a look at our package.json
we can see that jshint is under a different property called devDependecies
this tells node that this is a development dependecy and it should not go in the production enviroment

if we look in the node_modules folder jshint is in there so all of the dependencies whether they are 
application dependencies or development dependencies the are stored in the node_modules folder
they are segregated in the package.json
