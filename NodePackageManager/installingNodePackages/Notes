For this file will be notes for package.json in the install packages folder

so in this file we already did a npm init --yes if we remember this sets the default settings
on the package.json so we don't have to go through all the basic questions. After that we went to npmjs.org

On npmjs.org we have a plethora of 3rd party libraries we can add to our project
for this tutorial we are going to be using the underscore package. So on npmjs we 
searched underscore and we clicked on it.

Once we clicked on it we see quite a bit of information about the package the version number, the terminal command 
to install it and the source site to read more of it's documentation

the command we had to type was: npm i (short for install) underscore
after we run the command 2 things happen

first in the package.json we can see that we have a new property called dependencies and under that we have the underscore 
we added to the project.
So inside of our package.json we specify all the dependencies of our product and their version.

the current version of underscore we are using is: ^1.10.2
so when we run npm install npm is going to download the latest version of the given package
from the npm registry and then it will store it in a folder called node_modules
