This is the notes for updating local packages

in the real world as we build our applications there might be newer versions of the dependencies that we 
have installed we want to find out what packages have been outdated
and what are the new versions 

To find this information out we run this in terminal:
'npm outdated'

with this npm looks at the versions of our dependencies and compares them with what we have in npm registry

lets take a look at the mongoose we currently have installed 
right now we are running:

mongoose 2.4.2 and the version we want or npm tells us we want is 2.9.10
the reason why is because of the caret we have in front of the version number
in package.json because as long as the major version is 2 that means that we can use that release can be used in this application

so the latest 2 version is 2.9.10 and thats why we see it in the wanted section

following that we have the latest copy now in this case the latest version has a different major release
so at the time of taking these notes we have version 5.9.25
but we are using version 2 

now if we want to update the outdated packages
we would type this into the terminal:
'npm update'

however this only works for updating minor and patched releases
so when it updates it will go to the wanted version 

this is because we want to avoid updating to any major breaking changes because this might break our application

if we wanted to update the dependencies to their very latest version we can't do that with npm update

for that we are going to need a different command line tool
to do this we would type:
sudo npm i -g npm-check-updates

now if we run:
npm-check-updates 
we will see all of the outdated packages and their new versions 
so in this case we have mongoose 2.9.10 but the latest release is 5.9.25

if we look in terminal after running the command towards the bottom we will see 

ncu (which means npm-check-updates) with -u to upgrade package.json

now we are going to run ncu -u in terminal
now that we ran the command the dependency is not installed yet all we did was update the package.json

we can confirm in the package.json that the dependency was updated
after we check then we run
npm i

now if we run npm outdated nothing will show because everything is up to date
