this is the notes for updating a published package 

For this part we are going to be updating publishing package folder
this is because all the login info is typed into the terminal for it 
and instead of redoing all of it it will be simpler this way.

So first in the index.js in the NodePackageManager/publishingPackages/lion-lib
we are going to add a new function multiply

if we try to 'npm publish'
we will get an error this is because we already have the package published version 1 already
so depending on the kind of change we made we need to update the version number

in this case we added a new feature that wasn't a major change that doesn't break the app
we also didn't do any patches so this isn't a patch 
this is a minor update 

now we can go to the package.json and update the number or we can do it in terminal
this is some of the things we can type:
npm version major, to update the major version
npm version minor, to update the minor version
npm version patch, to update the patch version

so lets update the minor it'll bump our version to 1.1.0
then we publish it using 
npm publish
