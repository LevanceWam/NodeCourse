This is the notes for ImplementTheReturns

we are going to implement a new feature using TDD
we want to add the ability to return a movie

so our best option is to create a endpoint to return a movie
Now we want to do this instead of giving the user the ability to modify the rental fee  and dateReturned property because 
they can set it to zero or cause more trouble 

we want the value and date to be set by us

so we'll post to a endpoint called api/returns 
we  will post to this endpoint to send a return request or return command
in this request we need to add 2 ids movie and customer 
now on the server we'll look up the rental with the movie and customer id combonation
we'll get a document like our rental object  and here we well set the retuen date an dthe current date and time
then calculate the rentalFee

now that we have all of this information we know what we need to do to create our Test case which will be done in the next lecture.
