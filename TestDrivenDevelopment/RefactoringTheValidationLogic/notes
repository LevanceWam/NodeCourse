This is the notes for RefactoringTheValidationLogic

Now the beautiful part about writing test is that now that our file is 100% covered 
now we can refactor the function and come up with better implementation 
then if we run all the test and they pass we should be confident that we didnt break anything 

so lets get to refactoring 
The first thing we want to do is get rid of our validation logic and replace it with joi

now we may notice that we have this line in every file so 
we are going to make it a middleware function

dowmloaded the video it is a lot to cover
