This is the notes for TestingTheReturnDate
for this test we are going to set the return date 

now to get our expectation we need to get the rental document or the 
rental object from the database 

so we find the rental by by the id and store it in a constant 
now that we are not using the rental object here because this has beem
in the memory but when we execute the request somewhere esle we are modifying 
the database so that object in memory is not aware of changes in the database
this is why we need to reload the database 

now the expect we have here is general but we will edit it later 
we ran the generic test after writing code to make sure that it passed 

Now the next task at hand is this in our production code we need to set the current time
to the rental when it is saved 
but when we look at our test and when we are making that assertion against the property we don't 
have the current time it'll be different from the properties 

so when we are testing scenerios like this we should calculate the difference between the current time
and the value of the property and ensure the time in between is 10 secs in the worse case scenario

so first we are going to subtract
new Date() -  rentalInDb.dateReturned
this will return milliseconds 
we want to store this in a constant 
then we are going write and assertion to expect it to be less than 10 seconds 

we run the test and everything passed
now for the next test 
we are going to want to calculate the rental fee this fee is basically the number of days the movie has been out
