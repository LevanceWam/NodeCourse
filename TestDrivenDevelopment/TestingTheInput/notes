This is the notes for TestingTheInput

so the first thing we want to do is load a token to make sure the user is logged in but forgot the customer id
so dirst load the user module and generate a token 

Then in the response set the header 
now in the send method we are going to delete the customer id and just send the movie id

now at this point when we run the test it is going to fail 
this is because the route handler is currently always sending a 401 error
so lets modify the handler to make both test pass

so in routes/return.js we wrote simple code to get test to pass
now everything passes

Now we need to do something similar for the movieID
