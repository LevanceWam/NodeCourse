This is the notes for PopulatingTheDatabase

first we are going to want to create our file return.test.js and 
create the test suite 

now we need load the server and populuate the database before each test 
and then clean it up after 

now this time we are not going to need to remove/clear the genres instead we ned to delete the
rentals that we aere going to create 
for this we are going to need to load the rental module

now in the beforeEach function
we are going to create the rental object and this object takes the movie object and the Customer object 
dateOut will automatically fill its value so we dont have to worry about this (this is because we set it to default)

when we are setting the ids for the movie and the customer we want to store them in a variable 
because we are going to use the ids for posting the request

now we can use this variable in the body of our request when we send it 
we can also access it by typing rental.customer/movie but this makes our code messy

now that we have the rental object built we can save it to the database
remember this is a promise so we should await it 

now we are going to test it to see if everything works

the way we are going to test this is by looking for the rental id
so we are going to use Rental.findById and store it in a constant called result
then we take this result and expect it not to be null
