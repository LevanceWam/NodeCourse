This is the notes for TestCases

All right going of the last lecture we want to brainstorm and think of all
test cases we can think of this list can change or extend later 

when we send a request to this endpoint how should it behave 
first we should make sure that only authorize users can call this 

so we will write a test to:
Return 401 if the client is not logged in

next we want to assume that they did log in we want to check the customer id  and the movie id
if the id is not provided:
return 400 if customer Id is not provided
return 400 if movie id is not provided


now it is possible that the client sends both the customerid and the movie id
but we dont have a rental for this combo
so: 
Return 404 if no rental found for this customer/movie

now what if the rental is already processed as in the customer already returned the movie
return 400 for bad request:

Return 400 if rental already processed

Now that we got some of the negative cases lets look at somw positive cases

if we make it to this point we should be processing a valid return
so:

Return 200 if the request is valid
Set the return date 
calculate the rental fee
increase the stock (add the movie back to stock)

Finally what are we going to return to the client in the body of the response
we can return the summary of the rental:

Return the rental
