This is the notes for TestingTheValidRequest

Here we are writing a test to see if we have a valid request
so for this all we basically had to do was return a res of 200
the only thing was that this breaks our 401 endpoint that we made earlier for our authorization

The way to fix this is to remove the endpoint and load the auth module and pass it as a 
second argument in the handler and everything is passing 

for the next test we are going to set the return date
