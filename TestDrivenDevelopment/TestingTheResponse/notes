This is the notes for TestingTheResponse

for this test we are going to want to return the rental in the body of the response 
so for this test we want to expect the res.body to match the object of rentalInDb (the rental in the database)

now back in the routes/return file we need to write the code to make the code pass
which is passing the rental object in the return statement with the 200 status
now this fails the first time we ran this because of how 
the 2 properties dateOut and dateReturned are set

so in the rental object that we get from mongoose because these properties are set 
to date their value is a standard JS dateTime
However the object we are returning in the body of the response 
that's the standard that is formatted using json so the value is a string

this means that the assertion is a little to specific so we should try to make it a little more general
We should look for the existence of certain properties the body of the response

To make this a lot easier so we dont have to write a lot of toHaveProperties and make the code look messy
we can write it out in a arraycContaining to make the job a lot easier 
this is the same thing as doing that
