This is the notes for Middleware

One of the core concepts in express that we need to learn is the concept of Middleware/Middleware Functions
A Middleware function is basically a function that takes a request object
and either returns a response to the client or passes control to another middleware function

We have already seen 2 examples of middleware functions 
one is the route handler function.
In express every route handler function we have is techinally middleware function
because it takes a request option and from the way we used it previously in the last section it responds to the client
so it terminates the request response cycle 

That was one example of a middleware function
Another example is: app.use(express.json()); we've been using this a lot.

so when we call this method it returns a function a middleware function
the job of this function is to read the request and if there is a json object in the body of the request it will parse the 
body of the request into a json object and then it will set request.body property

So essentially this is what is happening at runtime:
when we get a request on the server the request goes through a pipeline
we call the pipeline the request processing pipeline
in the pipeline we have one or more middleware functions each middleware function either terminates the 
request response cycle by either returning the response object or it will pass control to another middleware function 

In our previous implementation our request processing pipeline has two middle functions 
the first one was the middleware function that parses the request.body into a json object
Now in this case it doesn't terminate the request response cycle so then it 
passes control to the second middleware function which is in this case our route handler 
in our route handler we have the request object with the body property populated
s here we can perform some operation and then terminate the request, response cycle by returning a response to the client 

express includes a few built in middleware function we can also create custom middleware function that we can put at the front 
of our request processing pipeline so every request that we get on the server will go through our middleware function, but this 
custom middleware functuin we can perform cross cutting concern
For example we can do logging authencation and so on

So an express appliction is essentially nothing but a bunch of middleware functions
