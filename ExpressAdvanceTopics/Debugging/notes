This is the notes for Debugging 

Console.log is JS oldest friend we use it for debugging 
the problem with this approach however is that sometimes when we are done with them 
we delete them or comment them out 

But sometime later we might need them so we have to write the code again or move the comment 
this is tedious, but there is a better way to do this 

a better way to log messages for the purpose of debugging is to use the debugging package in node 
we are going to replace all the console.log statements that are being called to debug a function
then we can use a environment variable to enable or disable Debugging

this way we don't have to come back to our code and modify the code 
we do not need to delete the console log or debug statements 
we dont have to comment them out we can control them from the outside 
using environment variables

but the most important part is that we can determine the level of debugging info we want to see 

Let's work on learning how to use a debug package
in terminal type this command:
npm i debug

(code line 1)
Lets load the debug module 
when we load the debug module it returns a function
so we call this function and give it an argument and this argument
is an arbtiraty namespace that we define for debugging 

for example we can define a namespace like app:startup
now when we call the function with this argument
we get a function for writing debugging messages 
Potentially we have another debugger for debugging database related messages]

Now on line 9 in our code we are going to change the console log statement 
with a call to startup debugger function
line 13 is for if we had database code to debug

Now we are going to go to the terminal and use a environment variable to determine what kind 
of debugging info we're going to see in the terminal

in terminal type:
export DEBUG=appstartup

this means we're going to only see debugging messages that are a part of startup 
now if we run the application in the terminal by using
nodemon nameOfFile.js we'll see the message 

If we want to set it to where we don't see anything we type This
export DEBUG=
no debugger will show in the terminal

If we want to see for multiple namespaces do this 
export DEBUG=appstartup, app:db
or use this wildcard to get all of the debuggers
export DEBUG=app:*

here is a shortcut to run the db without having to set it 
DEBUG=app:db nodemon nameOfFile.js
