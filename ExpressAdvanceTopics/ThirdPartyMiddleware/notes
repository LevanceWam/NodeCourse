this is the notes for third party middleware 

Let's look at some third party middleware for express
First we will head over to expressjs.com
on the top under resources go to middleware here 

Note: 
We should not try to use every middleware function that is there 
every function that is listed will impact the performance of our app 
so if we don't need it don't use it it'll slow down the request processing 

In this case the middleware that is considered best practice is helmet
it helps secure our application it helps secure the app by setting various http headers
to install we run npm i helmet

The other third party middleware we'll be using is called morgan 
morgan is used to log http request
npm i morgan
morgan is a function we can specify various formats depending on the argument we put in
(go to code line 14

we can look at the documentation for more agruments
now everytime we send a request to the server it will be logged 
when we look inside of the terminal we will see morgan logged it for us
