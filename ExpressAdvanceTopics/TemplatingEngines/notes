This is the notes for templating engines

All of the endpoints we did so far we returned json objects in response
However sometimes we need to return html markup to the client
this is where we use a templating engine

there are various templating engines for express apps
On of the popular ones is pug which use to be jade, mustache, ejs 
wach engine has a different syntax for generating dynamic html and returning it to the client 

so for this lecture we are going to learn how to use pug to return dynamic html to the client 

first install pug
'npm i pug'

(go to line 11 in code)
we need to set the engine for the application
when we set this  express will internally load this module 
so we don't have to require it 


(go to line 12 in code)
This is another setting that is not compulsory, it is optional
only if we want to override the path to the templates 
this means we need to put all the views or templates inside of a folder called views which should be 
in the root of the application
remember this is an optional setting thats the default value we do not have to set that

lets add a new folder called views inside of the folder create a file called index.pug
with pug we can define a template using syntax like (go to line 1 in index.pug)

Looking at this pug has a cleaner syntax than regular html we don't have the opening and closing elements 

lets look at how we can convert this to regular html and return to the client  

in index.js we set a route to the root of the application (line 48)
this is a simple message to the client now we can replace this with a html markup and return it to the client 
so instead of send we use render()
for the first argument we need to give the name of the file we are using which in this case is (index) for index.pug
for the second argument we pass a object 
this object includes all the values for the parameters that we have defined in the template

now start the project in terminal to start it up
