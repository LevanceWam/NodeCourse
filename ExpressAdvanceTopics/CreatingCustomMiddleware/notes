This is the notes for creating custom middleware

Let's create our custom middleware function
on line 5 we are going to adding a json middleware function

after that we are going call (go to code line 7)

we called app.use again to install a middleware function in a request function pipeline
(back to line 7 code)

so inside of of app.use we call a function with the parameters of req, res, and next
next is a reference to the next middleware function in the pipeline
so what we are going to do is pass a simple function like console.log and have it print out logging 
we are going to pretend like this middleware function is logging every request
then we call next to pass control to the next middleware function in the pipeline 

If we do not do this,because we are not terminating the request response cycle our request will end up
hanging.
So if we send even a simple http request we won't get a repsonse it'll be loading. 
this indicates that the middleware function was executed successfully but since we didn't 
pass control to another middleware function to terminate the response cycle our request is just hanging 

We can also make middleware functions for performing authentications (back to code line 12)

What we need to pay attention to here is that our middleware functions are called in sequence
first the logging middleware was called then middleware function for authenticating the user 
Then finally the route handler which is another middleware function

now when it comes to clean coding we want to put each of the middleware functions inside of their own file or module

so go and create a file name logger.js and authentication.js and put the code inside of the functions inside of those files 

we then want to give the function a name and then export the function out to be used in index.js
once exported go to the top of the index.js and import the 2 modules 

now let's finally explain what app.use(express.json()) does
So when we call express.json it returns a middleware function with 3 parameters req, res and next
this middleware function parses the request body and if there is a json object it will set request.body and 
it will pass control to the next middleware function
