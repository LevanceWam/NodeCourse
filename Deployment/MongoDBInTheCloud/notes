This is the notes for MongoDbInTheCloud

In this lecture we are going to learn how to make a mongoDB database in the cloud 
in the dashboard 
1.click the application that we want 
2.go to the resources tab 
3.find the add on section and click more add-ons

By default when we deploy to heroku we dont have a database if we want any kind of storage we are going to
to use a add on
once we click it we have plenty of add ons from email/sms, logging and much more
the add on we are going to use is called mlab 

4. click on the data store link and find mlab mongoDB
it is not here any more but thiere is a way around this 
we are going to go to the main site and create a account for free

Note that mlab has been taken over by MongoDB Atlas 
so far it is the same but we will see 

so after the account creation create a new cluster and choose your
cloud provider 

we are going to aws 

download the video to do the rest this is very hard
