This is the notes for SettingEnviromentVariables

we can set envirnoment variables using heroku cli 
type this into terminal:

heroku config:set wamVid_jwtPrivateKey=someValue

we are also going to set the node envirnoment to production this is going to 
improve the performance and generate less verbose messages

heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production

note that the envirnoment variables are case sensitive so make sure to use the right casing 
we can type This
heroku config 
to see all of the envirnoment variables we have set 

there is something about the cloud architecture in heroku we need to know about 
in heroku by default we have one server called a dino if we want to scale the application we will add more dinos 
these dinos have a temporary file system so everytime theyre restarted their 
file system is wiped out thats why you can't store anything in their file system 
so if you want to use storage there are various add ons for storing different kinds of data
we re going to look at that later 

the only thing that the dino/servers share are the envirnoment variables so if we have 10 dinos 
we don't need to explicity set these envirnoment variables on each dino
we set them at the application level and heroku will automatically replicate these across all
dinos 

since we set the envirnoment variables and everytime there is a change in one of these 
heroku will restart the application

so back to the logs we the app crashed again this time the mongo network filed 
because it could not connect to the server

this is because the connection string is set to the connection of a instance of mongoDB
running on local host

this is bad because we do not have a mongodb on heroku
