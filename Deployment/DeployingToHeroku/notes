This is the notes for DeployingToHeroku

with our source code in a git repo we can deploy the application
so here in the project folder we can run the command 

(in terminal)
heroku create (a name can be passed here if no name is passed then a default one is made )

this command does 2 things 
First it creates an app in heroku and second it creates a git remote in 
our local git envirnoment 

quick recap about git 
git is a distrubed source control system so here in this folder we have a git repo
but we can have one somewhere esle 
in this case we are going to have a git repo in heroku
now everytime we modify our code and commit the changes to the repo
the changes the updated source are in our local git repo lare we can push these changes 
from this local to ones like the one in heroku 

one we run the heroku create command heroku will create an application
then provide the address of the app on heroku

now in the project folder if we run 
git remote -v 
we can see the list of remote repos
this gives us the address of git repo

now we can deploy the app with git push heroku master
once it is done pushinh we get a address 
copy that address and paste it in postman

then lets send a get request to /api/genres

now we are going to get an error 503 service is unavailable 
we will have to deal with this time to time 

in the next lecture we are going to look at the logs to see what is wrong to fix the problem
