This is the notes for GettingStartedWithHeroku

in this lecture we are going to deploy our wamvid application to heroku 
the 2 steps we need to follow is that we need to create a account and download herokuCLI driver
Download here 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

(Next in terminal)
so after we make the account we need to login in:
heroku login

Heds up if the login fails on our side this is because 
we require the use of a proxy to connect with external http service 
if this is the case we need to set an envirnoment variable
on mac export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.server.com:1234
then try to log in
