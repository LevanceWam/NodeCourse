This is the notes for AddingTheCodeToGitRepository

before we deploy to heroku we need to add our source code inside of a git repositort
we need to make sure we have git on our machine 

now in the project folder we need to run 3 commands to put our source code inside of a git repo 
first we want to type in terminal:

git init

this initializes an empty git repo (locally)
now we need to add a .gitignore this 
file is used to exclude certian files and folders we don't need 

the next command we need to to run is 

git add . this command those staged files (files that are ready to be added to repo)
will be committed to the repo

so everything that is not in the gitignore will be committed into our repo

then we do git commit -m 'some message'
