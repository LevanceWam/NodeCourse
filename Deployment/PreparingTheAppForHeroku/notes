This is the notes for PreparingTheAppForHeroku

Now it is time to prepare the app to be deployed to heroku 
in package.json in the script property we need to define a npm command 
here

when we deploy the application on heroku it will look to start the application
with npm start but we don't have it defined yet

so in the script property we need to add the start command along with 
node index.js as the value to start our application
remember that nodemon is for development 

now write npm start to see of it runs (don't forget to set private key if you have one)
if it works we have one more thing to change to package.json

we need to add a new property called engines 
here we define the version of node we are using
in terminal run node -v to find out and copy it here 

with these changes we are ready to deploy to heroku
