This is the intro into the section

In this section we are going to learn how to deploy node applications 
we have 2 options for this

We can either use a platform as a service provider (PaaS) or we can use Docker

the difference:
With PaaS is a great option if we dont want to get involved with infrastructure  
if we don't want to worry about servers, load balancers, reverse proxies or restarting the 
applications on a crash then Paas is our best friend
We have quite a few options with this approach
heroku
google cloud platform
AWS
Azure

for this course we are going to use heroku because its easy and offers a lot of documentation


In contrast, if we wanted more control over the deployment 
if we want to deploy to our own web servers then docker is a great option
with docker we can easily create a image of our application and simply
deploy that image to any computer we want
