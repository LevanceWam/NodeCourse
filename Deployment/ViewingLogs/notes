This is the notes for ViewingLogs

to understand why our application crashed  we can look at heroku logs in the terminal or the 
dashboard we'll take a look at both ways 

so in terminal we type:
heroku logs

this brings up a report of what happened and can show us what happened 

the other option is to look at the dashboard 
we click on the applicstion and find the more link and navigate to the log 
now for some reason the logs on the dashboard doesn't tell us whats wrong so 
its a litle bit better to run it in terminal 

now the reason the application crashed is because we didn't define the envirnoment variable on heroku
we will do that in the next lecture.
