This is the notes for PreparingTheAppForProduction

So before we start with deployment we need to prepare the application
for production

we need to install a couple of packages
the first one we are downloading is 
helmet
npm i helmet
helmet is a middleware function that can protect our application from
well known web vulnerabilites for a refresher go back to express advance topics

the other package is called compression we use this to compress the http response that we send to the client
npm i compression

inside of the startup folder create a file called prod.js
all of the middleware we need to install for a production envirnoment will go here 
so the first one is helmet then compression

now we are going to want to export our function 
this function should take our application object because we wnat to use This
to install these middleware pieces

we use app.use to to get the middleware function
next in the index we are going to want to use the prod module there 
when we call the prod function we need to remember to pass the express appliction object
