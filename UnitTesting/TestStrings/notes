This is the notes for TestStrings

Now lets move on to the next function called greet 
this function takes a name and returns it in a new string 

so lets write a test that checks for this

after we finished writing the test we have an issue with it
The problem is that it is too specific and can break easily 
if we were to go back to the greet and modify it the test will fail

So the thing to learn from this is that our test shouldn't be top specific or 
too general

if it is too specific then it is very easy to break and if it is too general 
it might not give us the confidence in our code that we need 
so how can we make the current string test more general 

Well instead of testing for the exact equality we can look for certain patterns 
we can use a regular expression 

so instead of using the method toBe we can use toMatch and this just looks for the word we defined in the method
basically it looks to see if thre string contains it 
And if we don't want to use regular expressions we ca use toContain for the same result using strings

doing this way will help make it a little more general instead of having it the exact wording of the string 
we look for a certain part and this makes is less specific
