This is the notes for InteractionTesting

In this lecture we are going to be continuing from the 
last technique from the  prevoius lecture and see the things that are wrong with
it and then we are going to use a better mocking technique

This time we are going to use the notify customer function which is similar to the 
prevoius function we have to use the database object totget the customer from the database
then we have to use another object to send mail from the mail module 

so in the tests file we want to create the describe block and the it statment 
inside of the it statement we need to create the mock implementation
