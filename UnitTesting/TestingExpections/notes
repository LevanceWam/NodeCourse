This is the notes for TestingExpections

sometimes our functions can throw expections 
we are going to look at a function called 
registerUser that takes a username and if that user name is falsey
then it will throw an error if not it will return a id and the username 

to begin we see that this function has 2 execution paths
so we should at least come up with 2 test for this function

for the first test if the username is falsy we het an error here are some of our falsey values
Null
NAN
undefined
''
0
false

any of these will throw an expection
