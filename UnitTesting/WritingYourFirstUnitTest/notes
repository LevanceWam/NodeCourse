This is the notes for WritingYourFirstUnitTest

We have some premade files that we downloaded

Now we need to download jest but it is a little different this time around
npm i jest --save-dev

this is a development dependencies when we deploy the application we do not want this to be 
to be on the project it is for development use only

in package.json we are going to make a change to the scripts property here we can 
we can define tests that we want executed in the command line so for example for the one defined already 
we can run npm test and it will run

We are going to change the default to jest and run it 
this gives us the default result because we dont have any test but lets go build some 

first we will dtart with a new folder called tests
we are going to write test for the lib.js module

in the test folder we need to create a file for the module we are testing
it naming convention should look like this:
lib.test.js

Notice that we are writing the name of the file and then the the word test or spec
needs to follow it to indicate that this is where the test are being executed then js

now to write the test we call the test function this is one of the functions that comes with jest
this method takes 2 arguments the first agrument is the name of our test this is what we will see on the console
The second argument is a function that is used to implement the test when we run the test jest will call this function
so lets pass a empty arrow function for now and test it out in the terminal

when we run the test we get a summary of everything that happened whether we pased or failed 
and if we so happen to fail in the summary it will give us the exact line where the test failed at
