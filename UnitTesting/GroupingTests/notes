This is the notes for GroupingTests

Something very important to remember:
Test are first-class citizens in your source code
it is important as the production code 

Lets try to clean up our code and make it more easier to read 
and more effiencent 

so in jest and jasmine we have a function called describe()
this is used for grouping a bunch of related test 

so for the first agrument we just put the name like we did for test this lets us know that this 
group we are testing for is for the absolute function 

Next we are going to take all of the code we defined and place it inside of describe 
we also have another function called it() we can use it to replace test

Now if we look at the file it reads like english:
We are describing absolute and it:
    Should return a positive number if input is positive 
    and etc

in short always put related test in a describe block
