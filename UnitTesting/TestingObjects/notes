This is the notes for TestingObjects

for this lecture the function we are going to test 
will return a object with and id and a price 

first we want to create our describe block in lib.test.js
create our result constant and then write the expect statement 

Now the first expect statement we used the toBe method this will fail because this is object is located in a different 
location in memory so we are not referencing the same object in memory 

So instead of using the toBe method we are going to use the toEqual() method 
we just want to check that the object has these properties
with this we can check for object equality
run the test in terminal to make sure that it passes

Now when we test objects there are a couple more matchers that we can use 
one example is toMatchObject

but how are toEqual and toMatchObject different.

with toEqual both the source and the target objects should have exactly 2 properties
but sometimes when we get objects from somewhere esle it might have more than 50 properties
we dont want to write all of that out 

but with matcher if we were to add more properties to the object as long as the ones we put in the method exist then 
the test will pass so we don't have to write out all 50 properties and test for the ones that we want 

we should add another property to the object and test it out

there is one more wat we can use is .toHaveProperty() here we would just pass keyvalue pairs 
we can use this method to make sure that the property that we are searching for is there
