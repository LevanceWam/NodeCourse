This is the notes for WhatToUnitTest

Now we need to go to our wamVid app and open middleware function and 
open the admin file 
in this file we a simple middleware function with 2 execution paths 

however in this function we are working with external properties with a req and res agruments
so for this function we need to make mock functions with the same interface as the req and res objects in express

as a rule try lets try to unit test functions with little to no dependencies to external resources
we should also try to avoid doing a lot of mocks if there is too many we might as well do a integration test

so what can we actually unit test? well in model/user.js
we have a function called generateAuthToken in this method we simply generate a simple json token and return it 
we can call this method during the unit test get the result and verify if it is a json token
with this we dont have to create a mock function for this
