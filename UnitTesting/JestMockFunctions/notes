This is the notes for JestMockFunctions

In this lecture we are going to look at an easier way to run our 
test from the previous lecture 

in jest we have a method for creating mock function
this is a function with out a implementation a function with no code 
we can program the mock to return a specific value

We can also program it to return a promise  and reject them also
but if we reject them we have to put them in a try catch block the rejection would go in the catch vblock

with this we can simply the implementation of our earlier test 
now we don't have to create everything manually
