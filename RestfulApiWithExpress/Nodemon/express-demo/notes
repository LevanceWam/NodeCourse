This is the notes for nodemon

Up until this point we whenever we make a change we have to save 
and go into terminal and start up the server 

this is tedious prodecure especially if we have to make plenty of changes

there is a better way to handle this 
we need to install the node package nodemon
this is short for node monitor

in terminal we type:
sudo npm i -g nodemon

now instead of running:
node nameOfPackage 
we will run:
nodemon nameOfPackage

As we can see nodemon is watching all the files in this
folder any files with any extensions

So with any simple change and a save to the file nodemon will restart the server
