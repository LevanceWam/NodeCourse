This is notes for handling HTTP GET request

let's implement a new endpoint to get a single course from the server
we are going to define an array called courses
(go to code line 4)

since we have 2 endpoints one to get all of the courses and the other to get a single course 
in the first we will return the course array  so itll be changed from 
res.send([1,2,3]) to res.send(courses) (back to code on line 23)
