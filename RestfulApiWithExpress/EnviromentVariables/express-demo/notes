this is the notes for environmet variables 

One thing we need to improve that we have been doing so far is that 
we have been hard coding the value for the ports

we have been using 3000 as the arbitary number 

while this may work on our development machine it is 
unlikely that it will work for the production environment
this is because when we deploy this application to a hoisting environment
the port is dynamically assigned by the hosting enviroment 
so we can not rely on 3000 to be available 

the way to fix this is by using an enviroment variable
so typically in hosting enviroments for node applications 
we have this environment variable called ports

An environment variable is basically a variable that is part of the environment
in which a process runs. It's value is set from outside this application

so in our application we need to read the value of this port environment variable
we do that by using the process object (go to index.js)

// After running nodemon

So on the current machine we can see that we don't have an environment variable called port
this is why 3000 is being used as the port for the web server

lets try and set a environment variable 
in terminal for Mac type:

export PORT=5000 the reason why it is called PORT is becasue it is the name of our enviroment variable
