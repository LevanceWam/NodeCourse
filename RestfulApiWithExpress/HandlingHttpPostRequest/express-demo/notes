This is the notes for handling HTTP POST request

Let's learn how to respond to http POST request
We are going to use HTTP POST request to create a new course 
(go to code line 24)

In the POST route handler we need to read the course object that should be in the body of the request
we are going to use these request to create a new course object and then
add the course object to our course array.

so back in the code we are going to create a new course object
(go to code line 26)

NOTE: Because we aren't working in a database we need to manually assign a id
in the future when we work with databases the id will be assigned by the database 

(back to code line 32)

next is name property
we need to read this from the body of the request
here we are assuming that here in the body we have an object and that object has a name property
in order for this line to work we need to enable parsing of json objects in the body of the request 
because by default it is not enabled by express

so back at the top of the page line 3 we call express.json
(back to code line 3)

this looks a little strange but later in the section we are going to explore express.json in detail 
basicsally what we are doing is adding a piece of middleware so when call express.json 
the method returns a piece of middleware and then we call app.use to 
use the middleware in the reproccessing pipeline

Again we will look at this letter in the section

(back to code line 34)

by convention when we post an object to the server 
when the server is creating the new object or a new resource
we should return that object in the body of the response
(back to code line 37)

The reason for this is because we are assigning this id on the server. So we need to return this course object to the client
because chances are the client needs to know the id if this new object or new resource 
so this is how we handle http post request

in the next lecture we are going to test the endpoint
