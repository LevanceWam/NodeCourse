This is notes for Route Parameters

So far we have a route to get a list of courses
so now let's try to create a route and get a single course 

Remember earlier in the section  we talked about RESTful services
in order to get a single course we have to include the id in the url

so the endpoint should look like this (/api/courses/1)
(go to code)

so back in the browser if we type (/api/courses/1)
we have successfully read the value of this parameter

It is possible to have multiple parameters in a route

For Example:

We're building a service for powering a blog 
so we can have a route like this 
(/api/posts/:year/:month) now we have 2 Parameters
with these we can get all the posts for the given month and in the given year

now we can read the parameters like before 
we can set req.params to:
req.param.year or req.param.month

lets take a look at just the req.params object (back to code)

with express we can also get boolean string parameters
these are parameters that we add in the url after question mark

For example:
we can get all the posts in january 2018 and sort them by name 
so it would look like this:

/api/posts/2018/:1?sortBy=name)

this is a query string parameter we use query string parameter to 
provide additional data for our backend services so we use route parameter for essential or required values 
where as we use query string parameters for anything that is optional

Let's look at how to read query parameters(back to code)
