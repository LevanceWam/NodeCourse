Notes for handling HTTP put Request

Let'ssee how to update the course

we use the PUT method for updating resources 
the route we are using to update is:
'/api/courses/:id'
this is because we are dealing with a specific route 
(go to the put route)

What we need to implement:
first we need to look up the course by id // line 45 in code 
if the course doesn't exist we need to return 404 (means resource not found) // line 46 in code

otherwise we need to validate the course to make sure it's in good shape // line 50 in code
if invalid return a 400 error which means bad request // line 54 in code
for this part we will come back and edit it to work better

update course // line 60 in code 
return the updated course // line  61 in code

this is the logic we need to implement

so for lines 45 and 46 we duplicated the validation code we are going to
take this logic and extract them into seperate functions that we can reuse both in this route handler

the reason for this is because since we have a simple schema. What if we had a complex object with quite a few properties 
then our validation would be dupilcated in 2 different routes

lets go to line 64 and fix it now
