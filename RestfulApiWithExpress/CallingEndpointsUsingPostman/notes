This is the notes for CallingEndpointsUsingPostman

To call http services we use a chrome extension called postman
inside of postman we can create a new http request
In the url we change to the post command and then type in the url
http://localhost:3000/api/courses

now we need to set the body for this request 
for the list we select raw then json instead of text
with this we can put a json object in the body of the request

type this in the body (while the port is listening)

{
    "name":"course4"
}

then we hit the send button
if we scroll down the status of the request is 200
which means the request was handled successfully
now we have 4 courses in our array

this is how we test http services using postman

now with our current express-demo implementation we have 
assumed that there is an object with the same name property
in the body of the request.

What if the client forgets to send this property or sends an invalid name?

perhaps the name is too short

that is where input validation comes into the picture and thats is what we are going to learn next
