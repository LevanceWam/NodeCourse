Notes for HandlingHttpDeleteRequest

Lets learn how to respond to HTTP DELETE
How to implement delete:
(go to code line 59)

Look up the course // line 60 in code
if it doesn't exist return 404 // line 61 in code

delete it // lines 63 and 64 
we use the findIndex of to find the index of the course in the array
then we use the splice method to delete it 

//return the same course (by convention) // line 65

Fixing bugs:
Before we go any further there are a couple of small bugs in  the code 
if we look in the handlers responding to put request for the PUT endpoint 

if we don't have a course with a given id we return a 404 to the client 
but at this point we should exit the handler otherwise the rest of the code will be executed

the proper way to implement the handler is like this in line 48 in the code  
we return the response and exit the function

the previous files all have this tiny bug but since these are all the same just expanded this will be the one 
I reference

I can see all of the returns I added to the code.
