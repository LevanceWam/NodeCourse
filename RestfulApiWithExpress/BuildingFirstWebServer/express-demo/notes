this is the notes for building first web server

The object that is returned from the express() is called object app
so we store it in a constant called app

// the constant app is used to represent our application

the app object has a bunch of useful methods

we have methods like:
app.get();
app.post();
app.delete();
app.update();

So of we wanted to handle a post request and endpoint we would use 
app.post

if we want to learn about all the properties in req then we should look at the documentation on express
at expressjs.com in the api reference section
