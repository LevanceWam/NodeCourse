<p>Welcome to my Node.js tutorial here I will be learning everything I can about Node.js.</p>

<h3>What is Node:</h3>

<p>Node.js or node is a open source and cross platform runtime enviroment for executing Javascript code outside of a browser. We often use node to build backend services, also called API (Application Programming Interfaces). These are the services that power our client applications. Like a web app running inside of a browser or a mobile app running on a mobile device. These client apps are what the user sees and interacts with, they're just the surface. They need to talk to some services sitting on the server or the cloud to store data, send emails, push notifications, key cuff work flows and so on.</p>

<p>Node is ideal for building highly-scalable,data-intensive and real time back end services that power our client applications.</p>

<p>Node is easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development. It can also be used for building super fast and highly scaleable services. It's used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and plenty more. Fun Fact at Paypal they rebuilt one of their Java and spring based applications using node and found that the node application was built twice as fast with fewer people, in 33% fewer lines of code and 40% fewer files and more importantly they double the number of request served per secong while decreasing the aversage response time by 35%. Node is an excellent choice for building highly scaleable services.</p>

<p>Another reason to be using Node is that in Node applications we use Javascript so if you're a front end developer and know Javascript. You can reuse your Javascript skills and transitions to be a fullstack developer and get a better job with better pay. With this we can use javascript on the frontend and the back end and the source code will be cleaner anf more consistent. This allows us to use the same naming conventions, tools, and best practices. </p>

<p>Final reason to be using node is because it has the largest ecosystem of open-sourced libraries available to you. So for pretty much any features or building blocks you want to add to the application there is a free open source library out there that we can use. So we don't need to build everything from scratch.</p>
