This is the notes for Querying Documents

We are going to learn how to retrieve documents from the mongoDB 
first we are going to make another async function called getCourses

for this example we are going to change the createCourse function to getCourse function

lets start workingn in the new function
Our course class that we defined has a bunch of methods for querying document we have to get a list of documents

With the find method this method returns a document query object (line 33 code)
this document query object is kind of like a promise
we can await it and get the result
using this method we get all of the documents out of the database

we can also pass a filter
inside of the method, so as the first argument in the find method 
we pass an object and in this object we add one or more key value pairs for filtering 
this is how we retrieve our Documents

We can also sort our documents , we can set limits on the number of documents that are returned 
we can also select specific properties in documents

So if we get to a point where we have 50 properties we dont have to return all of them we can choose what we want 

So remember tht find returns a document query object (line 34 - 36)
so here we can customiz3 the query we can apply a limit()(line 37)

we can sort()(line 38) the documents
we pass object as the first argument and in the object we add one or more key value pairs for sorting

We also have a select() with this we can select the properties we want to be returned 
so in our example we are selecting the name and the tags
