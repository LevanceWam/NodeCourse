This is the notes for ComparsionQueryOperators 
The topic for this lecture is comparsion operators 

In mongodb we have a lot of operators for comparing
since mongoose is built on top of mongodb driver all of these operators are availiable 
in mongoose

Here are all of the comparsion operators in Mongodb:
eq = equal
ne = not equal
gt = greater than
gte = greater than or equal too
lt = less than 
lte = less than or equal too
in
nin = not in 

so in this example we want to pretend that in this we have a price value
so we want to get all of the course that is ten dollars
we would call the find method and pass our object for filtering and set the price to 10 dollars

if we wanted to get the courses over 10 dollars we can not do it with the current implementation we have going on Here
so in order to express the concept greater than 10 we have to pass an object
the object is a container for key object pairs 

We use the $ to indicate an operator so now we can use the comparsion operators

Lets take it a step further if we wanted to get the course that are between 10 and 20 dollars
to do this just add another operator to it (Commented out code)

another example would be to get the courses that are either 10, 15, or 20 dollars
so where we would normally add the price we pass an object and use the operators $in
we need to express our query where courses are 10, 15 or 20 dollars 
one way to deal with this is to use an array to express multiple values
