This is the notes for pagination

earlier we learned about the limit method
A method that goes hand and hand with it is the skip method

we use the skip method to implement pagination

first we define 2 constants pageNumber and pageSize for the sake of this example this is hard coded for simplicity
we do not do this in the real world for this method

in order to implement pagination we need to escape all the document in the 
previous page 

the formula to write this is in the code inside of the skip method 

in that code we are assuming page numeber starts from 1
we aslo change the limit to page size

now we get the documents from a given page
