This is the notes for schemas

Now we need to learn how to build a schema
A schema is used to define the shape of documents within
a collection in MongoDB

What does this mean? 
If we go to MongoDB Compass we created a database called playground and a collection called courses
A collection in MongoDB is like a table in a relational database 

In the collection we have 3 documents
A document in MongoDB is similar to a row in a relational database
In relational databases we have tables and rows 
In MongoDB we have Collections and documents
if we look inside of some of the documents we see a lot of json objects

in Mongoose we have somethong called schema it is not a part of MongoDB it is 
specific to Mongoose
We use a schema in Mongoose to define the shape of documents in a MongoDb collection
we use it to define what are the properties we have in the document 


Lets go create a schema
(Line 7 in code)
When we are creating an instance of this class we pass an object 
and in this object we specify the key value pairs that we should have in course documents

so for example we have a property name we set its key value to a string we do the same for the author property
Now when we are setting the tag we are going to use an array with strings
When this is stored each object in the array will be a key value pair
the key will be the index and the value will be the string

We are going to add a date property with  the type date
we can also give date a default value 

So instead of just adding the date type we can make the date property a object that
has a type property called date and also has a property called default and set it to Date.now
now that we have this we do not have to specify a date when creating a course object
Date.now will be used as the default value for this property

Here is the list of types we can use in creating a schema:
String 
Number 
Date
Buffer (used to store binary data);
Boolean
ObjectID (used for assigning unit identifers)
Array
