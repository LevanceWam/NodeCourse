This is the instructions for Exercise 2

For this Exercise we need to 
1. get all the published frontend and backend courses
2. sort them by price from most expensive to least
3. pick only the name and author
4. display

*Note:
We also could've used the in operator to accomplish what we did in this exercise instead 
of using the or operator like this :

.find({
            isPublished: true,
            tags: { $in: ['frontend', 'backend']}
        })
