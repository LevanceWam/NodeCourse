First we need to download the files provided files and 
run the command in the exercise.txt to move all of the information inside of the 
exercise-data.json file 

When that is completed we should see a new database called mongo-exercises with the collection called courses

After that we need to write a program that allows us:
1. to get all the published backend courses
2. sort them by their name
3. pick them by their name and author
4. display them
