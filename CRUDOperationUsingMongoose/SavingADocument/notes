This is the notes for saving a document 

Our course object has a method called save(). we are dealing with a asynchronous operation
its gonna take some time to save the course to the database, because we are dealing with the file system the 
result of this operation will be ready in the future

our method returns a promise we can await the results 
the result is an actual course object that is saved in the database 

When MongoDB saves the course it is going to give it a unqiue id

Remember since we are using await we have to have it inside of a async function

So when we run the program (node nameOfPackage.js)

the course we saved is now in the document we made in MongoDB compass

this is the beauty of MongoDB or NoSQL database unlike relational database we didnt have 
to scrape that table we simply created a document and stored it in our MongoDB database
