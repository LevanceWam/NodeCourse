Create a new folder mongo-demo
initalize npm in folder (create default package.json)
download mongoose package from npm:
npm i mongoose

Mongoose gives us a simple api to work with a mongo DB database
now we need to create our index.js

Now inside of index.js we need to connect to MongoDB 
so we need to load the mongoose module 
(go to line 1)

mongoose has a method called connect() used to connect to MongoDB (line 3)
inside of thre connect method we need to provide this string ('mongodb://localhost)
this references the MongoDB that we have installed on our local machine 

when it comes to the point where we need to deploy the application to a production environment we will use a different 
string

NOTE: For this example we are not going to be building our connection in a config file because it is not that complex
But we need to remember in a real world setting we need to do this 

Now we need to add the name of the database we are going to use  (line 3) 
for this example it will be playground

We don't need to create the database if we dont have it already
when we write something to the database MongoDB will automatically create this database for us

The mongoose connection returns a promise so we can go and use the 
then() to define some code when we connect to the database 

If something goes wrong we can use the catch() to return a error

finally we run the program by running it in terminal 
nodemon nameOfFile.js
