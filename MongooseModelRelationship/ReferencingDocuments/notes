This is the notes for ReferencingDocuments

In this lecture we are going to learn how to reference the author document inside of the course document 

first we had to get rid of the playground database we already had becasue we are going to start from scratch
then we are going to run the program in terminal to start up our new database and collection 

Once we have our author object we are going to take its id and place it in the createCourse function
by doing this the course object that is being created will reference the author object we created

So we run the create a course and see that the objectID and course were created 
but we didn't get a course property
this is because when we defined this course model we only added a name property so 
when saving the course the only property we have defined in the model will be persisted in the database

lets add the author property to the course model

so inside of the course model add the author property and pass a object 
inside of the object we need to pass the schemaType for the objectId 
then we set the property called ref and add the target of the collection which is author in this case 

So for the author property we are storing an objectID that references a author object

Remeber mongo does not care about relationships so we can add a invalid ref and mongo would not care
