This is the notes for ABetterImplementation

More than likely we are going to need to use the objectId method we defined in the last chapter
Instead of having to define it at the top of every single file we should define it one time and be done with it 
so we are going to define it inside of our index.js file that way it is availiable in all of our files 

Now we need to make sure that any file that has a id in it's joi schema has objectId inside of it 
Those files are:
models/rental
models/movie

One more thing we should go and fix is a few of our post routes
Starting with movies.js
We create a movie and save it to the database and return it 
in the current implementation we were ressetting the movie object after saving it to the database 
we only wanted to demostrate that the save method returns a movie document

Since the objectId is generated by mongodb driver and nit MongoDB database
mongoose talks to the driver and sets id when we new up it before saving the movie to the 
database

So we dont need to save the movie to return the id to the client 
so we can change movie to a constant and remove the movie variable from infront of the save

This is the same for a new cusomter and genre
