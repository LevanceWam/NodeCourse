This is the notes for objectId
we are going to take a look at objectIDs in MongoDB

So we notice that when save a document we get a ID property with a long string 
like this:
_id: 5573363746596036fuw49
we have 24 characters and every 2 represents a byte

we have 12 bytes to uniquely identify a document in MongoDb
first 4 bytes represents the time stamp 
becauseof this we dont have to create a propery or document like created at
because the timestamp is in the objectId

12 bytes
    4 bytes: timestamp when it was created we can extract this 
    3 bytes: machine indetifier
    2 bytes: process identifier
    3 bytes: counter
