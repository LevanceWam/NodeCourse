This is notes for ValidatingObjectIDs

In postman we try to send a invalid object Id to our rental
in the terminal we got a Promise rejection because we sent the 
wrong id to a model

The problem we are facing is that in postman when we sent the request 
we are not getting a response back we are there just waiting
the request is hanging we didn't handle the situation properly 

What we should get is a 400 error a bad request 

So what we could to do is create a if statement for both the customer and movie id
that way if the id is invalid we can send status 400 and a error message
But this is bad implementation a bad approach to this problem this is because we 
had already defined our validate function to validate our request.

So the logic we created to handle these errors should be in the validate function

now to extended our validation is a little bit complex and we do not need to repeat this everytime we have a validate function
Lucky for use there is a npm package for joi that we can download that handles ObjectIDs

'npm i joi-objectid'

this module returns a function we need to call the function and pass a reference to the joi module
remember the result of this module is a function so we can set Joi.objectId to the function
(I believe we just made a method on the Joi object that wasnt their already)
