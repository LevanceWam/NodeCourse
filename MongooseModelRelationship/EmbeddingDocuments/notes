This is the notes for EmbeddingDocuments

In this lecture we are going to be looking at the EmbeddingDocuments technique

so first we are going to add a author property
so in the population.js we had to add the author property and add the schemaType ObjectId to reference the author property

Well, when we are embedding a document all we have to do is 
set the type of the property to the authorSchema thats it

so before we run the createCourse function we need to delete the playground database again
now when we run the EmbeddingDocuments file in terminal we get a new course document 
we can see that author is a object with the id and the name 

This is what we call a embedded or sub document these subdocuments are like normal Documents
so some of the features on a normal document are available in sub documents
we can implement validation and etc

However, 
the subdocuments can not be saved on their own 
they can only be saved in the context of their parent

lets try to change the name of the author 
the first way we did it was by query first now lets try it with update first

first we get rid of the findById method and use the update method
Now since we are using doing update first we have to use the 
set operator and here we need to pass one or more key value pairs 
to access a nest of a property we need to use dot notation 

since we are using the update method there is no need for us to 
modify the object in memory and save it explicity
we are updating it directly to the database

now if we run it in terminal we can go and check in the database and see the changes

If we want to remove a subdocument we would use the unset operator
Lets try it out

in terminal we run the file and see the changes

As mentioned earlier the subdocuments are similar to normal
documents  so we can enforce validation like every course should have an author

to do this we would go to the course model and on the author property pass an object/ schemaType object 
set the type to authorSchema and required to true

If we want to make a specific property in the author subdocument required 
apply the validation on the author subdocument (where we define the schema shape) itself
