this is the notes for UsingAnArrayOfSubDocuments

In this lecture we are going to learn how to change the subdocument of author
to an array of subdocuments

first we are going to rename the property to authors
then we want to change the property into a array of properties
then in createCourse we also need to do the same so change the parameter to authors

now when we run the function on the second argument we pass an Array and the 2 author objects
make sure to go and delete the database again before we run the program

then in terminal we will see our new document with the authors we set to an array with 2 objects

lets try to add an author to the array now
also lets try to remove one
