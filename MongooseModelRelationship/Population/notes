this is the notes for Population

Lets comment out the create course function and run the get course function 
now that we know it works we need are going to add the author property to the select method

In terminal we notice that when the objects are printed for the author property the id is shown
in a real world application we want to load the author document and display the name 

This is where the populate method comes in 
after the find method we call the populate methis and as a first argument 
we need to specify a path to the given property
so in this case the property is author

Mongoose knows that since we referenced the author object in the course object 
when we go to populate it it'll query the author collection in mongodb
test it in the terminal and we see the author object

In a real world application an author would have mutiple properties 
maybe when showing the properties off in terminal we dont want al of the properties
well as a second argument we can specify which properties we want

now when we run the application we get the author id and name
lets try to exclude the id property now 

by the way it is possible to populate mutiple properties 
just add another populate and a property we want \

One quick note
Remember in mongo we don't have relationships for data integrity in the database
so if we go in and change a document into a invalid document mongodb will not care 
and if we run it in terminal the property we changed will come back as null 
so if we want to see it use the author id as an example
